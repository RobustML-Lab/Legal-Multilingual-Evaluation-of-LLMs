Language Feature Sets Used
===========================

This script computes language similarities based on multiple feature sets extracted from the lang2vec dataset.
Each feature set represents a different linguistic aspect of languages, allowing us to later correlate linguistic
distance with LLM performance on multilingual tasks.

Feature Set Categories:
------------------------

1. Syntax-based Features (grammar structure):
    - 'syntax_knn':
        Syntactic features compiled from sources like WALS, SSWL, and Ethnologue.
        Missing values are predicted using K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) smoothing based on typological similarity
        to other languages. This preserves natural linguistic diversity.

    - 'syntax_average':
        Features are averaged across available sources (e.g., WALS + SSWL) when overlap exists.
        No prediction or imputation is done â€” missing values remain missing if not present in any source.

2. Phonology-based Features (sound system properties):
    - 'phonology_knn':
        Phonological properties (e.g., tone, syllable structure) based on WALS and Ethnologue.
        Missing values are predicted using KNN smoothing based on phonological similarity.

    - 'phonology_average':
        Feature values are averaged across available sources when multiple databases report them.
        Provides a unified representation without artificial prediction.

3. Phonological Inventory Features (detailed sound inventories):
    - 'inventory_knn':
        Binary phoneme presence vectors from PHOIBLE and similar databases.
        Missing entries are predicted using KNN smoothing from phonologically similar languages.

    - 'inventory_average':
        Phoneme presence values are averaged across overlapping sources, resulting in fractional presence indicators.
        Reflects aggregated observations from different phonological inventories.

Special Handling:
-----------------
- 'average' feature sets aggregate values across multiple typological databases without
    attempting to fill in missing entries. Missing values remain as-is.

- 'knn' feature sets use a 10-nearest neighbors classification method to impute missing values,
    leveraging a weighted combination of genetic, geographic, and structural distances between languages.
    This method achieves 92.93% accuracy in 10-fold cross-validation for predicting typological features.
