            "21.6.2019\nEN\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nL 166/26\nCOMMISSION DELEGATED REGULATION (EU) 2019/980\nof 14 March 2019\nsupplementing Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the format, content, scrutiny and approval of the prospectus to be published when securities are offered to the public or admitted to trading on a regulated market, and repealing Commission Regulation (EC) No 809/2004\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,\nHaving regard to Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 June 2017 on the prospectus to be published when securities are offered to the public or admitted to trading on a regulated market, and repealing Directive 2003/71/EC (1), and in particular Article 9(14), paragraphs (1) and (2) of Article 13, Articles 14(3), 15(2) and 20(11) thereof,\nWhereas:\n(1)\nRegulation (EU) 2017/1129 lays down requirements to be complied with when drawing up prospectuses. The requirements concerning the scrutiny, review, approval and filing of the universal registration document and any amendments thereto, the requirements concerning the format of the prospectus, the base prospectus and the final terms, the specific information to be included in a prospectus, the minimum information to be included in the universal registration document, the reduced information to be included under the simplified disclosure regime for secondary issuances, the reduced content, the standardised format and the sequence of the EU Growth prospectus, the reduced content and standardised format of the specific summary and the scrutiny and approval of prospectuses all need to be specified.\n(2)\nThe content and the format of a prospectus depend on a variety of factors, such as the type of issuer, type of security, type of issuance as well as the possible involvement of a third party as a guarantor and the question of whether or not there is an admission to trading. It is therefore not appropriate to lay down the same requirements for all types of prospectuses. Specific information requirements should be laid down instead and should be combined depending on those factors and the type of prospectus. This should however not prevent an issuer, offeror or person asking for admission to trading on a regulated market to provide in the prospectus the most comprehensive information available.\n(3)\nTo ensure legal certainty and increase transparency for investors, issuers should state in their universal registration document whether the universal registration document has been approved by the competent authority or merely has been filed and published without prior approval.\n(4)\nThe alleviated information requirements for secondary issuances should reflect the specificities of equity and non-equity securities.\n(5)\nCollective investment undertakings of the close-end type pursue specific investment objectives and might be subject to specific investment restrictions. The registration documents for those undertakings should therefore be subject to specific information requirements.\n(6)\nDue to the indirect link between the investor and the underlying shares of depository receipts, it is important that the investor is informed about the issuer of the underlying shares. The prospectus for depository receipts should therefore contain, apart from information about the depositary receipt and the issuer of the depository receipt, information about the underlying shares and the issuer of those underlying shares.\n(7)\nThe information contained in prospectuses for non-equity securities should be adapted to the level of knowledge and expertise of each type of investor. Prospectuses for non-equity securities in which retail investors can invest should therefore be subject to more comprehensive and distinct information requirements than prospectuses for non-equity securities that are reserved to qualified investors.\n(8)\nThe obligation to produce a prospectus applies to non-equity securities issued by third countries and their regional and local authorities in cases where those entities wish to make a public offer of securities in the Union or wish their securities to be admitted to trading on a regulated market. Due to the particular nature of those public entities, specific information requirements should be laid down.\n(9)\nInvestors should be able to understand the situation of an issuer with a complex financial history and the expected effects of a transaction involving a significant financial commitment. Those issuers should therefore be required to include additional information in the prospectus to that effect.\n(10)\nWhere securities are exchangeable for or convertible into shares that are already admitted to trading on a regulated market, shareholders and investors normally already have the information about the underlying shares of those securities. It is therefore sufficient to add to the prospectus a statement setting out the type of the underlying share and details of where information about the underlying share can be obtained.\n(11)\nInvestors may want to invest in securities that are exchangeable for or convertible into shares that are or will be issued by the issuer of those securities or by an entity belonging to that issuer’s group and that have not yet been admitted to trading on a regulated market. Those investors should have the same information about the ability of the issuer of the underlying shares to continue its operations and about its indebtedness compared to its capitalisation as investors that have invested in those shares directly. The prospectus should therefore contain a working capital statement as well as a statement of capitalisation and indebtedness of the issuer of the underlying shares.\n(12)\nDerivative securities entail particular risks for investors because, for instance, the losses might be higher than the investment made and because the underlying is not always admitted to trading on a regulated market and information about that underlying might therefore not be available. Some non-equity securities, such as structured bonds, also incorporate certain elements of a derivative security. Consequently, the securities note should contain additional information about the underlying of a derivative security or about the derivative component of the non-equity security and, where applicable, a statement about the potential losses that investors might face.\n(13)\nWhere a base prospectus is drawn up for securities linked to or backed by an underlying asset, that base prospectus should contain all information about the type of underlying asset where that underlying asset is known at the date of approval of the base prospectus. Market conditions may however change the choice of the underlying asset within a category of underlying assets. Only the final terms of the base prospectus should therefore contain specific details about that underlying asset.\n(14)\nGuarantees are intended to ensure that the payments related to the security are duly serviced. Given the potential diversity in guarantees, clear information requirements related to the nature and the scope of those guarantees should be laid down.\n(15)\nThe format of the prospectus, base prospectus and final terms should be specified by determining the order in which the required information should be disclosed. However, due to the multipurpose character of the universal registration document, issuers who choose to draw up and publish a universal registration document every financial year should be granted more flexibility as regards the order of information to be provided in the universal registration document.\n(16)\nWhilst the base prospectus should contain all information available at the time of drawing up that base prospectus, it should be possible to leave blanks as regards specific information that only becomes available at a later stage and is to be found in the final terms, or to include a list of that missing information.\n(17)\nIt is not always required to include a summary into the prospectus. That should however not prevent the insertion of an overview section into the prospectus. To avoid confusion among investors, such overview section should however not be called a summary, unless it complies with all the requirements for summaries.\n(18)\nThe EU growth prospectus is intended to alleviate the administrative burden, in particular for SMEs. It is therefore appropriate to simplify the drafting of EU growth prospectuses by laying down a fixed order in which the information should be presented. However, to ensure that information is presented in a manner that is coherent and consistent with the different business models, flexibility should be allowed as regards the order of information items within each section of the EU growth prospectus.\n(19)\nTo allow for flexibility and to encourage the use of the EU growth prospectus, it should be possible that the EU growth prospectus is composed of separate documents. To avoid the risk of duplicating information, separate detailed information requirements for the specific registration document on the one hand and for the specific securities note on the other should be laid down and adapted to the type of securities concerned, differentiating between equity and non-equity securities.\n(20)\nThe specific summary of the EU Growth prospectus should provide investors with key information needed to decide which offers of securities they want to study further by reviewing the prospectus as a whole. It should therefore convey the essential characteristics of, and risks associated with, the issuer and the securities offered and contain the general terms and conditions of the offer. However, given that the specific summary is only an introduction to the EU Growth prospectus and must be read together with the other parts thereof, the content of the specific summary should be consistent with those other parts. To ensure that the size of the specific summary is tailored to the reduced size of the EU Growth prospectus, the length of the summary should be restricted.\n(21)\nTo ensure that competent authorities apply harmonised standards across the Union when scrutinising prospectuses, and in particular the completeness, comprehensibility and consistency of the information contained in draft prospectuses, criteria for prospectus scrutiny should be laid down. Those criteria should be applied for the entire draft prospectus and any of its constituent parts, including the universal registration document and any amendments and supplements to the prospectus.\n(22)\nA high level of investor protection should be ensured. Competent authorities should therefore be allowed to consider, where necessary, additional criteria for the scrutiny of the completeness, consistency and comprehensibility of draft prospectuses in order to adapt that scrutiny to the specific characteristics of a prospectus.\n(23)\nSome issuers are involved into very specific business activities that require a profound knowledge of the activities concerned to have a full understanding of the securities issued by those issuers. That would apply for example in the case of a property company that could be required to disclose a valuation report providing all relevant details in respect of material properties necessary for the purposes of the valuation. Competent authorities should therefore be able to take a proportionate approach and require, where appropriate, that those specialist issuers include in the prospectus specific and adapted information about those activities that goes beyond the information required from non-specialist issuers.\n(24)\nDue to the rapid evolution of securities markets, there is the possibility that certain types of securities that are not covered by the Annexes to this Regulation will be offered to the public or admitted to trading. In such a case, to enable investors to make an informed investment decision, competent authorities should decide in consultation with the issuer, offeror or person asking for admission to trading on a regulated market which information should be included in the prospectus.\n(25)\nTo drive efficiency in the process of drawing up the prospectus and eliminate unnecessary burdens, it is appropriate to allow the omission of information items set out in the Annexes to this Regulation that are not pertinent to the issuer or to the securities being offered or admitted to trading on a regulated market.\n(26)\nScrutiny and approval of prospectuses is an iterative process. As such, the decision of the competent authority to approve the draft prospectus may involve several rounds of analysis of the draft prospectus and ensuing improvements by the issuer, offeror or person asking for admission to trading on a regulated market to ensure that the draft prospectus meets the standards of completeness, comprehensibility and consistency. To provide certainty about the approval process, it is necessary to specify which documents should be provided to competent authorities at the different stages of the approval process.\n(27)\nFor reasons of efficiency, competent authorities should be permitted to carry out a lighter scrutiny where a draft prospectus replicates information that has already been scrutinised or reviewed.\n(28)\nTo enable competent authorities to search for specific terms or words in submitted documents and thus to ensure an efficient and timely scrutiny process of the prospectuses, draft prospectuses and accompanying information should be submitted in searchable electronic format and through electronic means acceptable to the competent authority.\n(29)\nIssuers, offerors or persons asking for admission to trading on a regulated market should be able to demonstrate to the competent authority how they addressed issues notified by that authority. Each draft of the prospectus submitted to the competent authority, with the exception of the first draft, should therefore contain both a marked-up version that clearly highlights all changes made to the previously submitted draft, and a clean version where such changes are not highlighted.\n(30)\nTo minimise delays in the scrutiny process, competent authorities should be able to identify quickly information requirements that are not applicable or not relevant. For that purpose, the competent authorities should be informed about the information that has not been included in the draft prospectus.\n(31)\nTo facilitate the drawing up of a prospectus and thus to facilitate the raising of capital by undertakings established in the Union, and to ensure that common standards are applied when scrutinizing and approving prospectuses, all requirements related to the format, content, scrutiny and approval of prospectuses should be laid down in a single Regulation.\n(32)\nSince this Delegated Regulation replaces Commission Regulation (EC) No 809/2004 (2), the latter has become obsolete and should therefore be repealed.\n(33)\nFor reasons of coherence, the application of this Regulation should be deferred until the date of application of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I\nDEFINITIONS\nArticle 1\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Regulation, the following definitions shall apply:\n(a)\n‘asset-backed securities’ means non-equity securities which either:\n(i)\nrepresent an interest in assets, including any rights intended to ensure the servicing of those assets, the receipt or the timely receipt by holders of those assets of the amounts payable under those assets;\n(ii)\nare secured by assets and the terms of the securities provide for payments calculated by reference to those assets;\n(b)\n‘equivalent third country market’ means a third country market which has been deemed equivalent to a regulated market in accordance with the requirements set out in third and fourth subparagraphs of Article 25(4) of Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (3);\n(c)\n‘profit estimate’ means a profit forecast for a financial period which has expired and for which results have not yet been published;\n(d)\n‘profit forecast’ means a statement that expressly or by implication indicates a figure or a minimum or maximum figure for the likely level of profits or losses for current or future financial periods, or contains data from which a calculation of such a figure for future profits or losses can be made, even if no particular figure is mentioned and the word ‘profit’ is not used;\n(e)\n‘significant gross change’ means a variation of more than 25 % to one or more indicators of the size of the issuer’s business.\nCHAPTER II\nCONTENT OF THE PROSPECTUS\nSECTION 1\nMinimum information to be included in the registration documents\nArticle 2\nRegistration document for equity securities\nFor equity securities, the registration document shall contain the information referred to in Annex 1 to this Regulation, unless it is drawn up in accordance with Articles 9, 14 or 15 of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129.\nArticle 3\nUniversal registration document\nA registration document that is drawn up in accordance with Article 9 of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 shall contain the information referred to in Annex 2 to this Regulation.\nArticle 4\nRegistration document for secondary issuances of equity securities\nA specific registration document for equity securities that is drawn up in accordance with Article 14 of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 shall contain the information referred to in Annex 3 to this Regulation.\nArticle 5\nRegistration document for units of closed-end collective investment undertakings\nFor units issued by collective investment undertakings of the closed-end type, the registration document shall contain the information referred to in Annex 4.\nArticle 6\nRegistration document for depository receipts issued over shares\nFor depository receipts issued over shares, the registration document shall contain the information referred to in Annex 5.\nArticle 7\nRegistration document for retail non-equity securities\nFor non-equity securities other than those referred to in Article 8(2) of this Regulation, the registration document shall contain the information referred to in Annex 6 to this Regulation, unless it is drawn up in accordance with Articles 9, 14 or 15 of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 or contains the information referred to in Annex 1 to this Regulation.\nArticle 8\nRegistration document for wholesale non-equity securities\n1.

It ensures that radio spectrum is available across the Union under harmonised conditions, eliminates barriers to the take-up of UWB technology and aims at creating an effective single market for UWB systems with significant economies of scale and benefits to the consumer.\n(2)\nAlthough ultra-wideband signals are typically of extremely low power, the possibility of harmful interference with existing radiocommunication services exists and needs to be managed. Therefore, this Decision on the harmonisation of radio spectrum for UWB equipment should avoid harmful interference (including where this might arise from access to the radio spectrum by radio astronomy, earth exploration satellite and space research systems) and balance the incumbent services' interests against the overall policy objective of providing favourable conditions for the introduction of innovative technologies for the benefit of society.\n(3)\nOn 16 March 2017, the Commission issued a permanent mandate, pursuant to Decision No 676/2002/EC, to the European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (‘CEPT’) to identify the technical conditions for the harmonised introduction of radio applications based on UWB technology in the Union in order to provide updated technical conditions for such applications.\n(4)\nIn response to that permanent mandate, CEPT adopted a report (3) where it proposed four measures. Firstly, the technical conditions should describe material sensing devices in a more neutral way in order to allow for innovative solutions. Secondly, it should be possible to use the conditions for generic UWB usage also for material sensing applications. Thirdly, there should be a – 65 dBm/MHz limit for all material sensing devices including building material analysis (BMA) in the 8,5-10,6 GHz band. Fourthly, the possibility of a trigger-before-transmit mitigation for vehicular access control systems based on UWB technology should be introduced in the 3,8-4,2 GHz and 6-8,5 GHz frequency bands.\n(5)\nThis Decision should support the overall harmonisation of the UWB regulatory framework in order to improve consistency of limits and mitigation techniques between the different UWB regulations and allow for innovative solutions in the field of UWB technology.\n(6)\nThis Decision provides for regulatory limits and identifies mitigation techniques to ensure an efficient usage of spectrum while ensuring coexistence with other spectrum users. Technological evolution may provide other solutions that ensure at least an equivalent level of spectrum protection. For this reason, the use of alternative mitigation techniques, such as solutions found in future possible harmonised standards produced by the European Standardisation Organisations, should be allowed provided they ensure at least an equivalent level of performance and spectrum protection and verifiably respect the established technical requirements of this regulatory framework.\n(7)\nDecision 2007/131/EC has been amended several times. In the interest of legal clarity Decision 2007/131/EC should be repealed.\n(8)\nThe measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Radio Spectrum Committee,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\nArticle 1\nThe purpose of this Decision is to harmonise the technical conditions for the availability and efficient use of radio spectrum by equipment using ultra-wideband technology in the Union.\nArticle 2\nFor the purposes of this Decision, the following definitions shall apply:\n(a)\n‘equipment using ultra-wideband technology’ means equipment incorporating, as an integral part or as an accessory, technology for short-range radiocommunication, involving the intentional generation and transmission of radio-frequency energy that spreads over a frequency range wider than 50 MHz, which may overlap several frequency bands allocated to radiocommunication services;\n(b)\n‘non-interference and non-protected basis’ means that no harmful interference may be caused to any radiocommunication service and that no claim may be made for protection of these devices against interference originating from radiocommunication services;\n(c)\n‘indoors’ means inside buildings or places in which the shielding will typically provide the necessary attenuation to protect radiocommunication services against harmful interference;\n(d)\n‘motor vehicle’ has the same meaning as set out in Article 3(11) of Directive 2007/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (4);\n(e)\n‘railway vehicle’ has the same meaning as set out in Article 3(1)(4) of Regulation (EU) 2018/643 of the European Parliament and of the Council (5);\n(f)\n‘e.i.r.p.’ means equivalent isotropically radiated power, which is the product of the power supplied to the antenna and the antenna gain in a given direction relative to an isotropic antenna (absolute or isotropic gain);\n(g)\n‘maximum mean power spectral density’ means the average power per unit bandwidth (centred on that frequency) radiated in the direction of the maximum level under the specified conditions of measurement and which is specified as e.i.r.p. of the radio device under test at a particular frequency;\n(h)\n‘peak power’ means the power contained within a 50 MHz bandwidth at the frequency at which the highest mean radiated power occurs, radiated in the direction of the maximum level under the specified conditions of measurement and which is specified as e.i.r.p.;\n(i)\n‘total power spectral density’ means the average of the mean power spectral density values measured over a sphere around the measurement scenario with a resolution of at least 15 degrees;\n(j)\n‘onboard aircraft’ means the use of radio links for communications purposes inside an aircraft;\n(k)\n‘LT1’ means systems intended for general location tracking of people and objects that can be put into service on an unlicensed basis.\nArticle 3\nWithin six months after this Decision takes effect, Member States shall designate and make available the radio spectrum, on a non-interference and non-protected basis, for equipment using ultra-wideband technology provided that such equipment meets the conditions set out in the Annex and it is used indoors or, if it is used outdoors, it is not attached to a fixed installation, a fixed infrastructure or a fixed outdoor antenna. Equipment using ultra-wideband technology which meets the conditions set out in the Annex shall also be allowed in motor and railway vehicles.\nArticle 4\nMember States shall monitor the use of the bands identified in the Annex by equipment using ultra-wideband technology, in particular to ensure that all the conditions laid down in Article 3 of this Decision continue to be relevant, and report their findings to the Commission.\nArticle 5\nDecision 2007/131/EC is repealed.\nArticle 6\nThis Decision is addressed to Member States.\nDone at Brussels, 14 May 2019.\nFor the Commission\nMariya GABRIEL\nMember of the Commission\n(1)  OJ L 108, 24.4.2002, p. 1.\n(2)  Commission Decision 2007/131/EC of 21 February 2007 on allowing the use of the radio spectrum for equipment using ultra-wideband technology in a harmonised manner in the Community (OJ L 55, 23.2.2007, p. 33).\n(3)  CEPT Report 69 – Report from CEPT to the European Commission in response to the Mandate ‘Ultra-Wideband technology in view of a potential update of Commission Decision 2007/131/EC’, approved on 26 October 2018 by the Electronic Communications Committee.\n(4)  Directive 2007/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 September 2007 establishing a framework for the approval of motor vehicles and their trailers, and of systems, components and separate technical units intended for such vehicles (OJ L 263, 9.10.2007, p. 1).\n(5)  Regulation (EU) 2018/643 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 April 2018 on rail transport statistics (OJ L 112, 2.5.2018, p. 1).\nANNEX\n1.

MATERIAL SENSING DEVICES USING UWB TECHNOLOGY\n5.1.   Introduction\nUWB material sensing devices are split into two classes:\n—\nContact based UWB material sensing devices, for which the UWB transmitter is only switched on when in direct contact with the material under investigation;\n—\nNon-contact based UWB material sensing devices, for which the UWB transmitter is only switched on when it is near the investigated material and the UWB transmitter is directed towards the material under investigation (for example manually by using a proximity sensor or by mechanical design).\nMaterial sensing devices based on UWB technology shall comply either with the generic UWB regulation based on technical conditions specified in section 1 of this Annex or with the specific limits for material sensing devices as defined in sections 5.2 and 5.3.\nThe generic UWB regulation excludes fixed outdoor installations. Emissions radiated by a material sensing device must not exceed the limits of the regulation for generic UWB usage specified in section 1. Material sensing devices must fulfil the requirements of mitigation techniques specified for the generic use of UWB in section 1.\nThe specific limits for material sensing devices including the mitigation techniques are listed in the following tables. Emissions radiating from material sensing devices permitted under this Decision must be kept to a minimum and in any case not exceed the emission limits within the following tables. Compliance with the specific limits must be ensured by the device placed on a representative structure of the investigated material. The specific limits listed in the following tables are applicable in all environments for material sensing devices, except those to which note 5 of these tables, which excludes fixed outdoor installation in certain applicable frequency ranges, applies.\n5.2.

( 2 ) the content and the format of a prospectus depend on a variety of factors, such as the type of issuer, type of security, type of issuance as well as the possible involvement of a third party as a guarantor and the question of whether or not there is an admission to trading. it is therefore not appropriate to lay down the same requirement for all types of prospectuses. specific information requirements should be laid down instead and must be combined depending on those factors and the type of prospectus. this should however not prevent whose issuer, offeror or person asking for admission to trading on a regulated market should provide in the prospectus the most comprehensive information available. ( 3 ) to ensure legal certainty and increase transparency for investors, issuers should state in their universal registration document whether the universal registration document has been approved by the competent authority or merely has been filed and published without prior approval. ( 4 ) the alleviated information requirements for secondary issuances should reflect the specificities of equity and non - equity securities. ( 5 ) collective investment undertakings of the close - end type pursue specific investment objectives and might be subject to specific investment restrictions. the registration documents for those undertakings should therefore be subject to specific information requirements. ( 6 ) due to the indirect link between the investor and the underlying shares of depository receipts, it is important that the investor is informed about the issuer of the underlying shares. the prospectus for depository receipts should therefore contain, apart from information about the depositary receipt and the issuer of the depository receipt, information about the underlying shares and the issuer of those underlying shares. ( 7 ) the information contained in prospectuses for non - equity securities should be adapted to the level of knowledge and expertise of each type of investor. prospectuses for non - equity securities in which retail investors can invest should therefore be subject to more comprehensive and distinct information requirements than prospectuses for non - equity securities that are reserved to qualified investors. ( 8 ) the obligation to produce a prospectus applies to non - equity securities issued by third countries and their regional and local authorities in cases where those entities wish to make a public offer of securities in the union or wish their securities to be admitted to trading on a regulated market. due to the particular nature of those public entities, specific information requirements should be laid down. ( 9 ) investors should be able to understand the situation of an issuer with a complex financial history and the expected effects of a transaction involving a significant financial commitment. those issuers should therefore be required to include additional information in the prospectus to that effect. ( 10 ) where securities are exchangeable for or convertible into shares that are already admitted to trading on a regulated market, shareholders and investors normally already have the information about the underlying shares of those securities. it is therefore sufficient to add to the prospectus a statement setting out the type of the underlying share and details of where information about the underlying share can be obtained. ( 11 ) investors may want to invest in securities that are exchangeable for or convertible into shares that are or will be issued by the issuer of those securities or by an entity belonging to that issuer ’ s group and that have not yet been admitted to trading on a regulated market. those investors should have the same information about the ability of the issuer of the underlying shares to continue its operations and about its indebtedness compared to its capitalisation as investors that have invested in those shares directly. the prospectus should therefore contain a working capital statement as well as a statement of capitalisation and indebtedness of the issuer of the underlying shares. ( 12 ) derivative securities entail particular risks for investors because, for instance, the losses might be higher than the investment made and because the underlying is not always admitted to trading on a regulated market and information about that underlying might therefore not be available. some non - equity securities, such as structured bonds, also incorporate certain elements of a derivative security. consequently, the securities note should contain additional information about the underlying of a derivative security or about the derivative component of the non - equity security and, where applicable, a statement about the potential losses that investors might face. ( 13 ) where a base prospectus is drawn up for securities linked to or backed by an underlying asset, that base prospectus should contain all information about the type of underlying asset where that underlying asset is known at the date of approval of the base prospectus. market conditions may however change the choice of the underlying asset within a category of underlying assets. only the final terms of the base prospectus should therefore contain specific details about that underlying asset. ( 14 ) guarantees are intended to ensure that the payments related to the security are duly serviced. given the potential diversity in guarantees, clear information requirements related to the nature and the scope of those guarantees should be laid down. ( 15 ) the format of the prospectus, base prospectus and final terms should be specified by determining the order in which the required information should be disclosed. however, due to the multipurpose character of the universal registration document, issuers who choose to draw up and publish a universal registration document every financial year should be granted more flexibility as regards the order of information to be provided in the universal registration document. ( 16 ) whilst the base prospectus should contain all information available at the time of drawing up that base prospectus, it should be possible to leave blanks as regards specific information that only becomes available at a later stage and is to be found in the final terms, or to include a list of that missing information. ( 17 ) it is not always required to include a summary into the prospectus. that should however not prevent the insertion of an overview section into the prospectus. to avoid confusion among investors, such overview section should however not be called a summary, unless it complies with all the requirements for summaries. ( 18 ) the eu growth prospectus is intended to alleviate the administrative burden, in particular for smes. it is therefore appropriate to simplify the drafting of eu growth prospectuses by laying down a fixed order in which the information should be presented. however, to ensure that information is presented in a manner that is coherent and consistent with the different business models, flexibility should be allowed as regards the order of information items within each section of the eu growth prospectus. ( 19 ) to allow for flexibility and to encourage the use of the eu growth prospectus, it should be possible that the eu growth prospectus is composed of separate documents. to avoid the risk of duplicating information, separate detailed information requirements for the specific registration document on the one hand and for the specific securities note on the other should be laid down and adapted to the type of securities concerned, differentiating between equity and non - equity securities. ( 20 ) the specific summary of the eu growth prospectus should provide investors with key information needed to decide which offers of securities they want to study further by reviewing the prospectus as a whole. it should therefore convey the essential characteristics of, and risks associated with, the issuer and the securities offered and contain the general terms and conditions of the offer. however, given that the specific summary is only an introduction to the eu growth prospectus and must be read together with the other parts thereof, the content of the specific summary should be consistent with those other parts. to ensure that the size of the specific summary is tailored to the reduced size of the eu growth prospectus, the length of the summary should be restricted. ( 21 ) to ensure that competent authorities apply harmonised standards across the union when scrutinising prospectuses, and in particular the completeness, comprehensibility and consistency of the information contained in draft prospectuses, criteria for prospectus scrutiny should be laid down. those criteria should be applied for the entire draft prospectus and any of its constituent parts, including the universal registration document and any amendments and supplements to the prospectus. ( 22 ) a high level of investor protection should be ensured. competent authorities should therefore be allowed to consider, where necessary, additional criteria for the scrutiny of the completeness, consistency and comprehensibility of draft prospectuses in order to adapt that scrutiny to the specific characteristics of a prospectus. ( 23 ) some issuers are involved into very specific business activities that require a profound knowledge of the activities concerned to have a full understanding of the securities issued by those issuers. that would apply for example in the case of a property company that could be required to disclose a valuation report providing all relevant details in respect of material properties necessary for the purposes of the valuation. competent authorities should therefore be able to take a proportionate approach and require, where appropriate, that those specialist issuers include in the prospectus specific and adapted information about those activities that goes beyond the information required from non - specialist issuers. ( 24 ) due to the rapid evolution of securities markets, there is the possibility that certain types of securities that are not covered by the annexes to this regulation will be offered to the public or admitted to trading. in such a case, to enable investors to make an informed investment decision, competent authorities should decide in consultation with the issuer, offeror or person asking for admission to trading on a regulated market which information should be included in the prospectus. ( 25 ) to drive efficiency in the process of drawing up the prospectus and eliminate unnecessary burdens, it is appropriate to allow the omission of information items set out in the annexes to this regulation that are not pertinent to the issuer or to the securities being offered or admitted to trading on a regulated market. ( 26 ) scrutiny and approval of prospectuses is an iterative process. as such, the decision of the competent authority to approve the draft prospectus may involve several rounds of analysis of the draft prospectus and ensuing improvements by the issuer, offeror or person asking for admission to trading on a regulated market to ensure that the draft prospectus meets the standards of completeness, comprehensibility and consistency. to provide certainty about the approval process, it is necessary to specify which documents should be provided to competent authorities at the different stages of the approval process. ( 27 ) for reasons of efficiency, competent authorities should be permitted to carry out a lighter scrutiny where a draft prospectus replicates information that has already been scrutinised or reviewed. ( 28 ) to enable competent authorities to search for specific terms or words in submitted documents and thus to ensure an efficient and timely scrutiny process of the prospectuses, draft prospectuses and accompanying information should be submitted in searchable electronic format and through electronic means acceptable to the competent authority. ( 29 ) issuers, offerors or persons asking for admission to trading on a regulated market should be able to demonstrate to the competent authority how they addressed issues notified by that authority. each draft of the prospectus submitted to the competent authority, with the exception of the first draft, should therefore contain both a marked - up version that clearly highlights all changes made to the previously submitted draft, and a clean version where such changes are not highlighted. ( 30 ) to minimise delays in the scrutiny process, competent authorities should be able to identify quickly information requirements that are not applicable or not relevant. for that purpose, the competent authorities should be informed about the information that has not been included in the draft prospectus. ( 31 ) to facilitate the drawing up of a prospectus and thus to facilitate the raising of capital by undertakings established in the union, and to ensure that common standards are applied when scrutinizing and approving prospectuses, all requirements related to the format, content, scrutiny and approval of prospectuses should be laid down in a single regulation. ( 32 ) since this delegated regulation replaces commission regulation ( ec ) no 809 / 2004 ( 2 ), the latter has become obsolete and should therefore be repealed. ( 33 ) for reasons of coherence, the application of this regulation should be deferred until the date of application of regulation ( eu ) 2017 / 1129, has adopted this regulation : chapter i definitions article 1 definitions for the purposes of this regulation, the following definitions shall apply : ( a ) ‘ asset -

            "16. 5. 2019 en official journal of the european union l 127 / 23 commission implementing decision ( eu ) 2019 / 785 of 14 may 2019 concerning the harmonisation of radio spectrum for equipment using ultra - wideband technology in the union and repealing title 2007 / 131 / ec ( notified under document c ( 2019 ) 3461 ) ( text with eea relevance ) the european commission, with regard to the treaty on the functioning of the european union, having regard to decision no 676 / 2002 / ec of the european parliament and of the council of 7 march 2002 on a comprehensive framework for radio spectrum policy in the european community ( radio spectrum decision ) ( 1 ), and in particular article 4 ( 3 ) thereof, whereas : ( 1 ) commission decision 2007 / 131 / ec ( 2 ) harmonises the technical conditions for spectrum use by radio equipment based on ultra - wideband ( ‘ uwb ’ ) technology in the union. it ensures that radio spectrum is available across the union under harmonised conditions, eliminates barriers to the take - up of uwb technology and aims on creating an effective single market for uwb systems with significant economies of scale and benefits to the consumer. ( 2 ) although ultra - wideband signals are typically of extremely low power, the possibility of harmful interference with existing radiocommunication services exists and needs to be managed. therefore, this decision on the harmonisation of radio spectrum for uwb equipment should avoid harmful interference ( including where this might arise from damage to the radio spectrum by radio astronomy, earth exploration satellite and space research systems ) and balance the incumbent services'interests against the general policy objective of providing favourable conditions for the introduction of innovative technologies for the benefit of society. ( 3 ) on 16 march 2017, the commission issued a permanent mandate, pursuant to decision no 676 / 2002 / ec, to the european conference of postal and telecommunications administrations ( ‘ cept ’ ) to identify the technical conditions for the harmonised introduction of radio applications based on uwb technology in the union in order to provide updated technical conditions by such applications. ( 4 ) in response of a permanent mandate, cept adopted a report ( 3 ) where it proposed four measures. firstly, the technical conditions should describe material sensing devices in a more neutral way in order to allow for innovative solutions. secondly, it should be possible to use the conditions for generic uwb usage also for material sensing applications. thirdly, there should be a – 65 dbm / mhz limit for all material sensing devices including building material analysis ( bma ) in the 8, 5 - 10, 6 ghz band. fourthly, the possibility of a trigger - before - transmit mitigation for vehicular access control systems based on uwb technology should be introduced in the 3, 8 - 4, 2 ghz and 6 - 8, 5 ghz frequency bands. ( 5 ) this decision should support the overall harmonisation of the uwb regulatory framework in order to improve consistency of limits and mitigation techniques between the different uwb regulations and allow for innovative solutions in the field of uwb technology. ( 6 ) this decision provides for regulatory limits and identifies mitigation techniques to ensure an efficient usage of spectrum while ensuring coexistence with other spectrum users. technological evolution may provide other solutions that ensure at least an equivalent level of spectrum protection. for this reason, the use of alternative mitigation techniques, such as solutions found in future possible harmonised standards produced by the european standardisation organisations, should be allowed provided they ensure at least an equivalent level of performance and spectrum protection and verifiably respect the established technical requirements of this regulatory framework. ( 7 ) decision 2007 / 131 / ec has been amended several times. in the interest of legal clarity decision 2007 / 131 / ec should be repealed. ( 8 ) the measures provided for in this decision are in accordance with the opinion of the radio spectrum committee, has adopted this decision : article 1 the purpose of this decision is to harmonise the technical conditions for the availability and efficient use of radio spectrum by equipment using ultra - wideband technology in the union. article 2 for the purposes of this decision, the following definitions shall apply : ( a ) ‘ equipment using ultra - wideband technology ’ means equipment incorporating, as an integral part or as an accessory, technology for short - range radiocommunication, involving the intentional generation and transmission of radio - frequency energy that spreads over a frequency range wider than 50 mhz, which may overlap several frequency bands allocated to radiocommunication services ; ( b ) ‘ non - interference and non - protected basis ’ means that no harmful interference may be caused to any radiocommunication service and that no claim may be made for protection of these devices against interference originating from radiocommunication services ; ( c ) ‘ indoors ’ means inside buildings or places in which the shielding will typically provide the necessary attenuation to protect radiocommunication services against harmful interference ; ( d ) ‘ motor vehicle ’ has the same meaning as set out in article 3 ( 11 ) of directive 2007 / 46 / ec of the european parliament and of the council ( 4 ) ; ( e ) ‘ railway vehicle ’ has the same meaning as set out in article 3 ( 1 ) ( 4 ) of regulation ( eu ) 2018 / 643 of the european parliament and of the council ( 5 ) ; ( f ) ‘ e. i. r. p. ’ means equivalent isotropically radiated power, which is the product of the power supplied to the antenna and the antenna gain in a given direction relative to an isotropic antenna ( absolute or isotropic gain ) ; ( g ) ‘ maximum mean power spectral density ’ means the average power per unit bandwidth ( centred on that frequency ) radiated in the direction of the maximum level under the specified conditions of measurement and which is specified as e. i. r. p. of the radio device under test at a particular frequency ; ( h ) ‘ peak power ’ means the power contained within a 50 mhz bandwidth at the frequency at which the highest mean radiated power occurs, radiated in the direction of the maximum level under the specified conditions of measurement and which is specified as e. i. r. p. ; ( i ) ‘ total power spectral density ’ means the average of the mean power spectral density values measured over a sphere around the measurement scenario with a resolution of at least 15 degrees ; ( j ) ‘ onboard aircraft ’ means the use of radio links for communications purposes inside an aircraft ; ( k ) ‘ lt1 ’ means systems intended for general location tracking of people and objects that can be put into service on an unlicensed basis. article 3 within six months after this decision takes effect, member states shall designate and make available the radio spectrum, on a non - interference and non - protected basis, for equipment using ultra - wideband technology provided that such equipment meets the conditions set out in the annex and it is used indoors or, if it is used outdoors, it is not attached to a fixed installation, a fixed infrastructure or a fixed outdoor antenna. equipment using ultra - wideband technology which meets the conditions set out in the annex shall also be allowed in motor and railway vehicles. article 4 member states shall monitor the use of the bands identified in the annex by equipment using ultra - wideband technology, in particular to ensure that all the conditions laid down in article 3 of this decision continue to be relevant, and report their findings to the commission. article 5 decision 2007 / 131 / ec is repealed. article 6 this decision is addressed to member states. done at brussels, 14 may 2019. for the commission mariya gabriel member of the commission ( 1 ) oj l 108, 24. 4. 2002, p. 1.

Χρειάζεται να διευκρινιστούν όλες οι απαιτήσεις που αφορούν τον έλεγχο, την εξέταση, την έγκριση και την κατάθεση του γενικού εγγράφου αναφοράς και τυχόν τροποποιήσεών του, τις απαιτήσεις που αφορούν τη μορφή του ενημερωτικού δελτίου, του βασικού ενημερωτικού δελτίου και των τελικών όρων, τις ειδικές πληροφορίες που πρέπει να περιλαμβάνονται στο ενημερωτικό δελτίο, τις ελάχιστες πληροφορίες τις οποίες πρέπει να περιλαμβάνει το γενικό έγγραφο αναφοράς, τις μειωμένες πληροφορίες που πρέπει να περιλαμβάνονται βάσει του απλοποιημένου καθεστώτος γνωστοποίησης για δευτερογενείς εκδόσεις, το μειωμένο περιεχόμενο, τον τυποποιημένο μορφότυπο και τη σειρά του ενημερωτικού δελτίου ανάπτυξης ΕΕ, το μειωμένο περιεχόμενο και τον τυποποιημένο μορφότυπο του ειδικού περιληπτικού σημειώματος, καθώς και τον έλεγχο και την έγκριση των ενημερωτικών δελτίων.\n(2)\nΤο περιεχόμενο και η μορφή του ενημερωτικού δελτίου εξαρτώνται από διάφορους παράγοντες, όπως το είδος του εκδότη, το είδος της κινητής αξίας, το είδος της έκδοσης, καθώς και από την πιθανή συμμετοχή τρίτου ως εγγυητή, όπως και από το ζήτημα αν υπάρχει ή όχι εισαγωγή προς διαπραγμάτευση. Ως εκ τούτου, δεν είναι σκόπιμο να καθοριστούν οι ίδιες απαιτήσεις για όλα τα είδη ενημερωτικών δελτίων. Αντιθέτως, θα πρέπει να καθοριστούν ειδικές απαιτήσεις πληροφόρησης, οι οποίες θα πρέπει να συνδυάζονται ανάλογα με αυτούς τους παράγοντες και το είδος του ενημερωτικού δελτίου. Ωστόσο, το γεγονός αυτό δεν θα πρέπει να εμποδίζει τον εκδότη, τον προσφέροντα ή το πρόσωπο το οποίο ζητά την εισαγωγή προς διαπραγμάτευση σε ρυθμιζόμενη αγορά να παρέχει στο ενημερωτικό δελτίο τις πληρέστερες δυνατές διαθέσιμες πληροφορίες.\n(3)\nΓια να κατοχυρωθεί η ασφάλεια δικαίου και να αυξηθεί η διαφάνεια για τους επενδυτές, οι εκδότες θα πρέπει να δηλώνουν στο γενικό έγγραφο αναφοράς τους αν το γενικό έγγραφο αναφοράς έχει εγκριθεί από την αρμόδια αρχή ή αν έχει απλώς κατατεθεί και δημοσιευθεί χωρίς προηγούμενη έγκριση.\n(4)\nΟι απλούστερες απαιτήσεις πληροφόρησης για δευτερογενείς εκδόσεις θα πρέπει να αντικατοπτρίζουν τις ιδιαιτερότητες των μετοχικών και των μη μετοχικών κινητών αξιών.\n(5)\nΟι οργανισμοί συλλογικών επενδύσεων κλειστού τύπου επιδιώκουν την επίτευξη ειδικών επενδυτικών στόχων και ενδέχεται να υπόκεινται σε ειδικούς επενδυτικούς περιορισμούς. Επομένως, τα έγγραφα αναφοράς για τους οργανισμούς αυτούς θα πρέπει να υπόκεινται σε ειδικές επενδυτικές απαιτήσεις.\n(6)\nΛόγω του έμμεσου δεσμού μεταξύ του επενδυτή και των υποκείμενων μετοχών των αποθετηρίων εγγράφων, είναι σημαντικό να ενημερώνεται ο επενδυτής σχετικά με τον εκδότη των υποκείμενων μετοχών. Ως εκ τούτου, το ενημερωτικό δελτίο για αποθετήρια έγγραφα θα πρέπει να περιλαμβάνει, εκτός από τις πληροφορίες σχετικά με το αποθετήριο έγγραφο και τον εκδότη του αποθετηρίου εγγράφου, και πληροφορίες σχετικά με τις υποκείμενες μετοχές και τον εκδότη αυτών των υποκειμένων μετοχών.\n(7)\nΟι πληροφορίες που περιλαμβάνονται στα ενημερωτικά δελτία για μη μετοχικές κινητές αξίες θα πρέπει να προσαρμόζονται ανάλογα με το επίπεδο γνώσεων και εμπειρογνωμοσύνης των διαφόρων ειδών επενδυτών. Τα ενημερωτικά δελτία για μη μετοχικές κινητές αξίες στις οποίες μπορούν να επενδύσουν επενδυτές λιανικής θα πρέπει, επομένως, να υπόκεινται σε περισσότερο εκτενείς και διακριτές απαιτήσεις παροχής πληροφοριών, σε σύγκριση με τα ενημερωτικά δελτία για μη μετοχικές κινητές αξίες οι οποίες απευθύνονται σε ειδικούς επενδυτές.\n(8)\nΗ υποχρέωση κατάρτισης ενημερωτικού δελτίου εφαρμόζεται σε μη μετοχικές κινητές αξίες που εκδίδονται από τρίτες χώρες και τις περιφερειακές και τοπικές αρχές τους, σε περιπτώσεις όπου οι οντότητες αυτές επιθυμούν να προβούν σε δημόσια προσφορά κινητών αξιών στην Ένωση ή επιθυμούν να εισαχθούν οι κινητές αξίες τους προς διαπραγμάτευση σε ρυθμιζόμενη αγορά. Λόγω της ιδιαίτερης φύσης των εν λόγω δημόσιων οντοτήτων, θα πρέπει να καθοριστούν ειδικές απαιτήσεις πληροφόρησης.\n(9)\nΟι επενδυτές θα πρέπει να είναι σε θέση να κατανοούν την κατάσταση ενός εκδότη με σύνθετο χρηματοοικονομικό ιστορικό, καθώς και τα αναμενόμενα αποτελέσματα μιας συναλλαγής που συνεπάγεται σημαντική χρηματοοικονομική δέσμευση. Συνεπώς, θα πρέπει να απαιτείται από τους συγκεκριμένους εκδότες να συμπεριλαμβάνουν στο ενημερωτικό δελτίο πρόσθετες πληροφορίες για τον σκοπό αυτό.\n(10)\nΌταν οι κινητές αξίες είναι ανταλλάξιμες ή μετατρέψιμες σε μετοχές που έχουν ήδη εισαχθεί προς διαπραγμάτευση σε ρυθμιζόμενη αγορά, οι μέτοχοι και οι επενδυτές συνήθως διαθέτουν ήδη πληροφόρηση σχετικά με τις υποκείμενες μετοχές των συγκεκριμένων κινητών αξιών. Επομένως, αρκεί να προστίθεται στο ενημερωτικό δελτίο μια δήλωση στην οποία να αναφέρεται το είδος της υποκείμενης μετοχής, καθώς και λεπτομέρειες για τα σημεία αναζήτησης πληροφοριών σχετικά με την υποκείμενη μετοχή.\n(11)\nΟι επενδυτές ενδέχεται να θέλουν να επενδύσουν σε κινητές αξίες ανταλλάξιμες ή μετατρέψιμες σε μετοχές οι οποίες έχουν εκδοθεί ή πρόκειται να εκδοθούν από τον εκδότη αυτών των κινητών αξιών ή από οντότητα που ανήκει στον όμιλο του συγκεκριμένου εκδότη, και οι οποίες δεν έχουν ακόμη εισαχθεί προς διαπραγμάτευση σε ρυθμιζόμενη αγορά. Οι εν λόγω επενδυτές θα πρέπει να διαθέτουν την ίδια πληροφόρηση σχετικά με την ικανότητα του εκδότη των υποκείμενων μετοχών να συνεχίσει τις δραστηριότητές του, καθώς και σχετικά με το χρέος του συγκριτικά με την κεφαλαιοποίησή του, δεδομένου ότι πρόκειται για επενδυτές που έχουν επενδύσει άμεσα στις συγκεκριμένες μετοχές. Συνεπώς, το ενημερωτικό δελτίο θα πρέπει να περιλαμβάνει δήλωση για το κεφάλαιο κίνησης, καθώς και δήλωση για την κεφαλαιοποίηση και το χρέος του εκδότη των υποκείμενων μετοχών.\n(12)\nΤα παράγωγα μέσα συνεπάγονται ιδιαίτερους κινδύνους για τους επενδυτές, διότι, για παράδειγμα, αφενός, οι ζημίες μπορεί να είναι μεγαλύτερες από την πραγματοποιηθείσα επένδυση και, αφετέρου, το υποκείμενο στοιχείο δεν εισάγεται πάντοτε προς διαπραγμάτευση σε ρυθμιζόμενη αγορά, επομένως ενδέχεται να μην υπάρχουν πάντοτε διαθέσιμες πληροφορίες σχετικά με αυτό το υποκείμενο στοιχείο. Ορισμένες μη μετοχικές κινητές αξίες επίσης, όπως τα δομημένα ομόλογα, έχουν ενσωματωμένα κάποια στοιχεία παράγωγων μέσων. Κατά συνέπεια, το σημείωμα εκδιδόμενου τίτλου θα πρέπει να περιέχει πρόσθετες πληροφορίες σχετικά με το υποκείμενο στοιχείο ενός παράγωγου μέσου ή σχετικά με τη συνιστώσα παραγώγου μιας μη μετοχικής κινητής αξίας και, κατά περίπτωση, δήλωση σχετικά με τις δυνητικές ζημίες τις οποίες ενδέχεται να αντιμετωπίσουν οι επενδυτές.\n(13)\nΌταν καταρτίζεται βασικό ενημερωτικό δελτίο για κινητές αξίες που συνδέονται ή εξασφαλίζονται με υποκείμενο περιουσιακό στοιχείο, το εν λόγω βασικό ενημερωτικό δελτίο θα πρέπει να περιλαμβάνει όλες τις πληροφορίες σχετικά με το είδος του υποκείμενου περιουσιακού στοιχείου, εφόσον το εν λόγω περιουσιακό στοιχείο είναι γνωστό κατά την ημερομηνία έγκρισης του βασικού ενημερωτικού δελτίου. Ωστόσο, οι συνθήκες της αγοράς ενδέχεται να αλλάξουν την επιλογή του υποκείμενου περιουσιακού στοιχείου εντός μιας κατηγορίας υποκείμενων περιουσιακών στοιχείων. Επομένως, μόνο στους τελικούς όρους του βασικού ενημερωτικού δελτίου θα πρέπει να περιλαμβάνονται ειδικές λεπτομέρειες σχετικά με αυτό το υποκείμενο περιουσιακό στοιχείο.\n(14)\nΟι εγγυήσεις αποσκοπούν στην εξασφάλιση της δέουσας εξυπηρέτησης των πληρωμών που συνδέονται με την κινητή αξία. Δεδομένης της ποικιλομορφίας που ενδέχεται να χαρακτηρίζει τις εγγυήσεις, θα πρέπει να καθοριστούν σαφείς απαιτήσεις πληροφόρησης όσον αφορά τη φύση και το αντικείμενο των συγκεκριμένων εγγυήσεων.\n(15)\nΗ μορφή του ενημερωτικού δελτίου, του βασικού ενημερωτικού δελτίου και των τελικών όρων θα πρέπει να προσδιορίζεται με τον καθορισμό της σειράς με την οποία θα πρέπει να γνωστοποιούνται οι απαιτούμενες πληροφορίες. Ωστόσο, λόγω των πολλαπλών χρήσεων του γενικού εγγράφου αναφοράς, οι εκδότες που επιλέγουν να καταρτίζουν και να δημοσιεύουν σε κάθε οικονομικό έτος ένα γενικό έγγραφο αναφοράς θα πρέπει να διαθέτουν μεγαλύτερη ευελιξία όσον αφορά τη σειρά των πληροφοριών που πρέπει να παρέχονται στο γενικό έγγραφο αναφοράς.\n(16)\nΜολονότι το βασικό ενημερωτικό δελτίο θα πρέπει να περιέχει όλες τις πληροφορίες που είναι διαθέσιμες κατά τη χρονική στιγμή της κατάρτισής του, θα πρέπει να είναι δυνατόν να μένουν κενά όσον αφορά ειδικές πληροφορίες που είναι διαθέσιμες μόνο σε μεταγενέστερο στάδιο και απαντούν στους τελικούς όρους, ή να συμπεριλαμβάνεται κατάλογος με τις πληροφορίες που λείπουν.\n(17)\nΔεν απαιτείται πάντοτε η συμπερίληψη περιληπτικού σημειώματος στο ενημερωτικό δελτίο. Αυτό, ωστόσο, δεν θα πρέπει να εμποδίζει τη συμπερίληψη τμήματος επισκόπησης στο ενημερωτικό δελτίο. Για να αποφευχθεί η σύγχυση μεταξύ των επενδυτών, το εν λόγω τμήμα επισκόπησης δεν θα πρέπει, όμως, να αποκαλείται περιληπτικό σημείωμα, εκτός εάν πληροί όλες τις απαιτήσεις των περιληπτικών σημειωμάτων.\n(18)\nΣκοπός του ενημερωτικού δελτίου ανάπτυξης ΕΕ είναι να μειωθεί ο διοικητικός φόρτος, ιδίως για τις ΜΜΕ. Ως εκ τούτου, είναι σκόπιμο να απλουστευθεί η κατάρτιση των ενημερωτικών δελτίων ανάπτυξης ΕΕ, μέσω του καθορισμού σταθερής σειράς με την οποία θα πρέπει να παρουσιάζονται οι πληροφορίες. Ωστόσο, για να διασφαλιστεί ότι οι πληροφορίες παρουσιάζονται με συνεκτικό τρόπο και σύμφωνα με τα διαφορετικά επιχειρηματικά μοντέλα, θα πρέπει να δοθεί η δυνατότητα ευελιξίας όσον αφορά τη σειρά των πληροφοριών σε κάθε τμήμα του ενημερωτικού δελτίου ανάπτυξης ΕΕ.\n(19)\nΓια να υπάρχει ευελιξία και για να ενθαρρυνθεί η χρήση του ενημερωτικού δελτίου ανάπτυξης ΕΕ, θα πρέπει να είναι δυνατόν να απαρτίζεται το ενημερωτικό δελτίο ανάπτυξης ΕΕ από χωριστά έγγραφα. Για να αποφευχθεί ο κίνδυνος αλληλεπικάλυψης των πληροφοριών, θα πρέπει να προβλέπονται χωριστές λεπτομερείς απαιτήσεις πληροφόρησης, αφενός, για το ειδικό έγγραφο αναφοράς και, αφετέρου, για το ειδικό σημείωμα εκδιδόμενου τίτλου, και να προσαρμόζονται στο εκάστοτε είδος των κινητών αξιών, με διάκριση μεταξύ μετοχικών και μη μετοχικών κινητών αξιών.\n(20)\nΤο ειδικό περιληπτικό σημείωμα του ενημερωτικού δελτίου ανάπτυξης ΕΕ θα πρέπει να παρέχει στους επενδυτές τις απαιτούμενες βασικές πληροφορίες, προκειμένου να αποφασίζουν ποιες προσφορές κινητών αξιών επιθυμούν να μελετήσουν περαιτέρω, εξετάζοντας το σύνολο του ενημερωτικού δελτίου. Θα πρέπει, επομένως, να αποδίδει τα ουσιαστικά χαρακτηριστικά του εκδότη και των κινητών αξιών που αποτελούν το αντικείμενο της προσφοράς, καθώς και τους κινδύνους που συνδέονται με αυτά, και να περιέχει τους γενικούς όρους και τις προϋποθέσεις της προσφοράς. Όμως, δεδομένου ότι το ειδικό περιληπτικό σημείωμα αποτελεί απλώς εισαγωγή στο ενημερωτικό δελτίο ανάπτυξης ΕΕ και πρέπει να διαβάζεται μαζί με τα άλλα μέρη του, το περιεχόμενο του ειδικού περιληπτικού σημειώματος θα πρέπει να έχει συνεκτικότητα με αυτά τα άλλα μέρη. Για να διασφαλιστεί ότι το μέγεθος του ειδικού περιληπτικού σημειώματος είναι προσαρμοσμένο στο μειωμένο μέγεθος του ενημερωτικού δελτίου ανάπτυξης ΕΕ, η έκταση του περιληπτικού σημειώματος θα πρέπει να είναι περιορισμένη.\n(21)\nΓια να εξασφαλιστεί ότι οι αρμόδιες αρχές εφαρμόζουν εναρμονισμένα πρότυπα σε ολόκληρη την Ένωση κατά τον έλεγχο των ενημερωτικών δελτίων, και ιδίως όσον αφορά την πληρότητα, τη δυνατότητα κατανόησης και τη συνεκτικότητα των πληροφοριών που περιλαμβάνονται στα ενημερωτικά δελτία, θα πρέπει να καθιερωθούν κριτήρια για τον έλεγχο των ενημερωτικών δελτίων. Τα εν λόγω κριτήρια θα πρέπει να εφαρμόζονται στο σύνολο του σχεδίου ενημερωτικού δελτίου και στα συστατικά μέρη του, συμπεριλαμβανομένων του γενικού εγγράφου αναφοράς και τυχόν τροποποιήσεων και συμπληρωμάτων του ενημερωτικού δελτίου.\n(22)\nΘα πρέπει να κατοχυρώνεται υψηλό επίπεδο προστασίας των επενδυτών. Συνεπώς, οι αρμόδιες αρχές θα πρέπει να έχουν τη δυνατότητα να εξετάζουν, όπου απαιτείται, πρόσθετα κριτήρια για τον έλεγχο της πληρότητας, της συνεκτικότητας και της δυνατότητας κατανόησης των σχεδίων ενημερωτικών δελτίων, προκειμένου να προσαρμόζουν τον εν λόγω έλεγχο στα ειδικά χαρακτηριστικά ενός ενημερωτικού δελτίου.\n(23)\nΟρισμένοι εκδότες ασχολούνται με πολύ ειδικές επιχειρηματικές δραστηριότητες, για τις οποίες απαιτείται βαθιά γνώση, προκειμένου να υπάρχει πλήρης κατανόηση των κινητών αξιών που εκδίδονται από τους εν λόγω εκδότες. Αυτή θα ήταν, για παράδειγμα, η περίπτωση εταιρείας ακινήτων που θα ήταν υποχρεωμένη να γνωστοποιήσει μια έκθεση αποτίμησης, όπου παρέχονται όλες οι σχετικές λεπτομέρειες όσον αφορά τα σημαντικά ακίνητα, οι οποίες είναι αναγκαίες για τους σκοπούς της αποτίμησης. Ως εκ τούτου, οι αρμόδιες αρχές θα πρέπει να είναι σε θέση να ακολουθούν μια αναλογική προσέγγιση και να απαιτούν, κατά περίπτωση, από τους ειδικούς αυτούς εκδότες να συμπεριλαμβάνουν στο ενημερωτικό δελτίο ειδικές και προσαρμοσμένες πληροφορίες σχετικά με τις εν λόγω δραστηριότητες, οι οποίες να υπερβαίνουν τις πληροφορίες που απαιτούνται από μη ειδικούς εκδότες.\n(24)\nΛόγω της ταχείας εξέλιξης των αγορών κινητών αξιών, υπάρχει η πιθανότητα ορισμένα είδη κινητών αξιών που δεν καλύπτονται από τα παραρτήματα του παρόντος κανονισμού να αποτελέσουν αντικείμενο δημόσιας προσφοράς ή εισαγωγής προς διαπραγμάτευση. Σε τέτοια περίπτωση, για να μπορούν οι επενδυτές να λαμβάνουν επενδυτική απόφαση κατόπιν ενημέρωσης, οι αρμόδιες αρχές θα πρέπει να αποφασίζουν, σε διαβούλευση με τον εκδότη, τον προσφέροντα ή το πρόσωπο που ζητά την εισαγωγή προς διαπραγμάτευση σε ρυθμιζόμενη αγορά, ποιες πληροφορίες θα πρέπει να περιλαμβάνονται στο ενημερωτικό δελτίο.\n(25)\nΓια την προώθηση της αποτελεσματικότητας κατά τη διαδικασία κατάρτισης του ενημερωτικού δελτίου και για την εξάλειψη των περιττών επιβαρύνσεων, είναι σκόπιμο να επιτρέπεται η παράλειψη στοιχείων πληροφοριών που παρατίθενται στα παραρτήματα του παρόντος κανονισμού, τα οποία δεν είναι σχετικά με τον εκδότη ή τις κινητές αξίες που προσφέρονται ή εισάγονται προς διαπραγμάτευση σε ρυθμιζόμενη αγορά.\n(26)\nΟ έλεγχος και η έγκριση των ενημερωτικών δελτίων αποτελούν επαναληπτική διαδικασία. Λόγω αυτού, η απόφαση της αρμόδιας αρχής να εγκρίνει το σχέδιο ενημερωτικού δελτίου μπορεί να περιλαμβάνει διάφορους γύρους ανάλυσης του σχεδίου ενημερωτικού δελτίου και επακόλουθες βελτιώσεις από τον εκδότη, τον προσφέροντα ή το πρόσωπο που ζητά την εισαγωγή προς διαπραγμάτευση σε ρυθμιζόμενη αγορά, ώστε να εξασφαλίζεται ότι το σχέδιο ενημερωτικού δελτίου πληροί τα πρότυπα πληρότητας, δυνατότητας κατανόησης και συνεκτικότητας. Για να υπάρχει βεβαιότητα σχετικά με τη διαδικασία έγκρισης, είναι αναγκαίο να διευκρινιστεί ποια έγγραφα θα πρέπει να παρέχονται στις αρμόδιες αρχές στα διάφορα στάδια της διαδικασίας έγκρισης.\n(27)\nΓια λόγους αποτελεσματικότητας, θα πρέπει να επιτρέπεται στις αρμόδιες αρχές να διενεργούν λιγότερο αυστηρό έλεγχο, σε περιπτώσεις όπου στο σχέδιο ενημερωτικού δελτίου επαναλαμβάνονται πληροφορίες οι οποίες έχουν ήδη ελεγχθεί ή εξεταστεί.\n(28)\nΓια να μπορούν οι αρμόδιες αρχές να αναζητούν ειδικούς όρους ή λέξεις σε υποβληθέντα έγγραφα και, ως εκ τούτου, να διασφαλίζουν την αποτελεσματικότητα και τον έγκαιρο χαρακτήρα της διαδικασίας ελέγχου των ενημερωτικών δελτίων, τα σχέδια ενημερωτικών δελτίων και οι συνοδευτικές πληροφορίες θα πρέπει να υποβάλλονται σε ηλεκτρονική μορφή με δυνατότητα αναζήτησης και μέσω ηλεκτρονικών μέσων που είναι αποδεκτά από την αρμόδια αρχή.\n(29)\nΟι εκδότες, οι προσφέροντες και τα πρόσωπα που ζητούν την εισαγωγή προς διαπραγμάτευση σε ρυθμιζόμενη αγορά θα πρέπει να είναι σε θέση να αποδεικνύουν στην αρμόδια αρχή πώς αντιμετώπισαν τα ζητήματα που τους κοινοποίησε η εν λόγω αρχή. Κάθε σχέδιο του ενημερωτικού δελτίου που υποβάλλεται στην αρμόδια αρχή, με εξαίρεση το πρώτο προσχέδιο, θα πρέπει, συνεπώς, να περιέχει έκδοση με επισημάνσεις, στην οποία να επισημαίνονται ευκρινώς όλες οι αλλαγές που έγιναν στο προηγουμένως υποβληθέν σχέδιο, καθώς και μια καθαρή έκδοση στην οποία δεν επισημαίνονται αυτές οι αλλαγές.\n(30)\nΓια να ελαχιστοποιηθούν οι καθυστερήσεις στη διαδικασία ελέγχου, οι αρμόδιες αρχές θα πρέπει να είναι σε θέση να εντοπίζουν γρήγορα τις απαιτήσεις πληροφόρησης που δεν είναι εφαρμοστέες ή δεν είναι σχετικές. Για τον σκοπό αυτό, οι αρμόδιες αρχές θα πρέπει να ενημερώνονται σχετικά με τις πληροφορίες που δεν έχουν συμπεριληφθεί στο σχέδιο ενημερωτικού δελτίου.\n(31)\nΌλες οι απαιτήσεις που αφορούν τη μορφή, το περιεχόμενο, τον έλεγχο και την έγκριση ενημερωτικών δελτίων θα πρέπει να καθοριστούν σε έναν ενιαίο κανονισμό, αφενός, για να διευκολυνθεί η κατάρτιση ενημερωτικού δελτίου και, συνεπώς, η άντληση κεφαλαίων από επιχειρήσεις εγκατεστημένες στην Ένωση, και, αφετέρου, για να διασφαλιστεί η εφαρμογή κοινών προτύπων κατά τον έλεγχο και την έγκριση ενημερωτικών δελτίων.\n(32)\nΕφόσον ο παρών κατ’ εξουσιοδότηση κανονισμός αντικαθιστά τον κανονισμό (ΕΚ) αριθ. 809/2004 της Επιτροπής (2), ο κανονισμός (ΕΚ) αριθ. 809/2004 καθίσταται πλέον άνευ αντικειμένου και, επομένως, θα πρέπει να καταργηθεί.\n(33)\nΓια λόγους συνοχής, η εφαρμογή του παρόντος κανονισμού θα πρέπει να μετατεθεί μέχρι την ημερομηνία εφαρμογής του κανονισμού (ΕΕ) 2017/1129,\nΕΞΕΔΩΣΕ ΤΟΝ ΠΑΡΟΝΤΑ ΚΑΝΟΝΙΣΜΟ:\nΚΕΦΑΛΑΙΟ I\nΟΡΙΣΜΟΙ\nΆρθρο 1\nΟρισμοί\nΓια τους σκοπούς του παρόντος κανονισμού, ισχύουν οι ακόλουθοι ορισμοί:\nα)   \n«κινητές αξίες εξασφαλισμένες με περιουσιακά στοιχεία»\n: μη μετοχικές κινητές αξίες για τις οποίες ισχύει ένα από τα ακόλουθα:\ni)\nαντιπροσωπεύουν δικαίωμα σε περιουσιακά στοιχεία, περιλαμβανομένων τυχόν δικαιωμάτων που προορίζονται να διασφαλίσουν την εξυπηρέτηση των εν λόγω περιουσιακών στοιχείων, την είσπραξη ή την έγκαιρη είσπραξη, από τους κατόχους των εν λόγω περιουσιακών στοιχείων, των πληρωτέων ποσών που καταβάλλονται στο πλαίσιο αυτών των περιουσιακών στοιχείων·\nii)\nείναι εξασφαλισμένες με περιουσιακά στοιχεία, και οι όροι των κινητών αξιών προβλέπουν την καταβολή πληρωμών οι οποίες υπολογίζονται σε σχέση με τα εν λόγω περιουσιακά στοιχεία·\nβ)   «ισοδύναμη αγορά τρίτης χώρας»: η αγορά τρίτης χώρας που έχει θεωρηθεί ισοδύναμη με ρυθμιζόμενη αγορά, σύμφωνα με τις απαιτήσεις που καθορίζονται στο άρθρο 25 παράγραφος 4 τρίτο και το τέταρτο εδάφιο της οδηγίας 2014/65/ΕΕ του Ευρωπαϊκού Κοινοβουλίου και του Συμβουλίου (3)·\nγ)   «εκτίμηση κερδών»: πρόβλεψη κέρδους κλεισθείσας διαχειριστικής χρήσης για την οποία δεν έχουν ακόμη δημοσιευθεί τα αποτελέσματα·\nδ)   «πρόβλεψη κερδών»: δήλωση όπου αναφέρεται ρητά ή υποδεικνύεται έμμεσα ένας αριθμός ή ένας κατώτατος ή ανώτατος αριθμός για το πιθανό επίπεδο των κερδών ή ζημιών για την τρέχουσα διαχειριστική χρήση ή τις μελλοντικές χρήσεις, ή που περιέχει δεδομένα βάσει των οποίων μπορούν να γίνουν υπολογισμοί του αριθμού αυτού για μελλοντικά κέρδη ή ζημίες, ακόμη και εάν δεν αναφέρεται συγκεκριμένος αριθμός ούτε χρησιμοποιείται η λέξη «κέρδος»·\nε)   «σημαντική μεταβολή της συνολικής κατάστασης»: μεταβολή κατά περισσότερο από 25 % σε έναν ή περισσότερους δείκτες του μεγέθους των επιχειρηματικών δραστηριοτήτων του εκδότη.\nΚΕΦΑΛΑΙΟ II\nΠΕΡΙΕΧΟΜΕΝΟ ΤΟΥ ΕΝΗΜΕΡΩΤΙΚΟΥ ΔΕΛΤΙΟΥ\nΤΜΗΜΑ 1\nΕλάχιστες πληροφορίες που πρέπει να περιλαμβάνονται στα έγγραφα αναφοράς\nΆρθρο 2\nΈγγραφο αναφοράς για μετοχικές κινητές αξίες\nΓια τις μετοχικές κινητές αξίες, το έγγραφο αναφοράς περιέχει τις πληροφορίες που αναφέρονται στο παράρτημα 1 του παρόντος κανονισμού, εκτός εάν καταρτίζεται σύμφωνα με το άρθρο 9, 14 ή 15 του κανονισμού (ΕΕ) 2017/1129.\nΆρθρο 3\nΓενικό έγγραφο αναφοράς\nΈνα έγγραφο αναφοράς που καταρτίζεται σύμφωνα με το άρθρο 9 του κανονισμού (ΕΕ) 2017/1129 περιέχει τις πληροφορίες που αναφέρονται στο παράρτημα 2 του παρόντος κανονισμού.\nΆρθρο 4\nΈγγραφο αναφοράς για δευτερογενείς εκδόσεις μετοχικών κινητών αξιών\nΈνα ειδικό έγγραφο αναφοράς για μετοχικές κινητές αξίες, που καταρτίζεται σύμφωνα με το άρθρο 14 του κανονισμού (ΕΕ) 2017/1129, περιέχει τις πληροφορίες που αναφέρονται στο παράρτημα 3 του παρόντος κανονισμού.\nΆρθρο 5\nΈγγραφο αναφοράς για μερίδια οργανισμών συλλογικών επενδύσεων κλειστού τύπου\nΓια τα μερίδια που εκδίδονται από οργανισμούς συλλογικών επενδύσεων κλειστού τύπου, το έγγραφο αναφοράς περιέχει τις πληροφορίες που αναφέρονται στο παράρτημα 4.\nΆρθρο 6\nΈγγραφο αναφοράς για αποθετήρια έγγραφα μετοχών\nΓια τα αποθετήρια έγγραφα μετοχών, το έγγραφο αναφοράς περιέχει τις πληροφορίες που αναφέρονται στο παράρτημα 5.\nΆρθρο 7\nΈγγραφο αναφοράς για μη μετοχικές κινητές αξίες λιανικής\nΓια τις μη μετοχικές κινητές αξίες πλην εκείνων που αναφέρονται στο άρθρο 8 παράγραφος 2 του παρόντος κανονισμού, το έγγραφο αναφοράς περιέχει τις πληροφορίες που αναφέρονται στο παράρτημα 6 του παρόντος κανονισμού, εκτός εάν καταρτίζεται σύμφωνα με το άρθρο 9, 14 ή 15 του κανονισμού (ΕΕ) 2017/1129 ή περιέχει τις πληροφορίες που αναφέρονται στο παράρτημα 1 του παρόντος κανονισμού.\nΆρθρο 8\nΈγγραφο αναφοράς για μη μετοχικές κινητές αξίες χονδρικής\n1.

Η απόφαση αυτή εξασφαλίζει ότι το ραδιοφάσμα είναι διαθέσιμο σε ολόκληρη την Ένωση υπό εναρμονισμένους όρους, εξαλείφει τα εμπόδια για την υιοθέτηση της τεχνολογίας UWB και στοχεύει στη δημιουργία μιας πραγματικά ενιαίας αγοράς για τα συστήματα UWB, με σημαντικές οικονομίες κλίμακας και οφέλη για τους καταναλωτές.\n(2)\nΜολονότι η εξαιρετικά χαμηλή ισχύς είναι τυπικό χαρακτηριστικό των σημάτων υπερευρείας ζώνης, υπάρχει δυνατότητα επιβλαβούς παρεμβολής σε υφιστάμενες υπηρεσίες ραδιοεπικοινωνιών, η οποία πρέπει να αποτελέσει αντικείμενο διαχείρισης. Κατά συνέπεια, με την παρούσα απόφαση για την εναρμόνιση του ραδιοφάσματος για εξοπλισμό UWB θα πρέπει να αποφεύγονται οι επιβλαβείς παρεμβολές (συμπεριλαμβανομένων εκείνων που μπορεί να προκύψουν από την πρόσβαση σε ραδιοφάσμα της ραδιοαστρονομίας, δορυφορικών συστημάτων γεωσκόπησης και έρευνας του διαστήματος) και να εξισορροπούνται τα συμφέροντα των κατεστημένων υπηρεσιών σε σχέση με τον γενικό πολιτικό στόχο διαμόρφωσης ευνοϊκών συνθηκών για την εισαγωγή καινοτόμων τεχνολογιών προς όφελος της κοινωνίας.\n(3)\nΣτις 16 Μαρτίου 2017, η Επιτροπή εξέδωσε μόνιμη εντολή, δυνάμει της απόφασης αριθ. 676/2002/ΕΚ, στην Ευρωπαϊκή Διάσκεψη Ταχυδρομικών και Τηλεπικοινωνιακών Οργανισμών («CEPT») για τον προσδιορισμό των τεχνικών όρων της εναρμονισμένης εισαγωγής ραδιοεφαρμογών τεχνολογίας υπερευρείας ζώνης στην Ένωση, με σκοπό την παροχή επικαιροποιημένων τεχνικών όρων για τις εν λόγω εφαρμογές.\n(4)\nΑνταποκρινόμενη στην εν λόγω μόνιμη εντολή, η CEPT εξέδωσε έκθεση (3) στην οποία πρότεινε τέσσερα μέτρα. Πρώτον, στους τεχνικούς όρους οι συσκευές ανίχνευσης υλικών θα πρέπει να περιγράφονται με πιο ουδέτερο τρόπο, ώστε να επιτρέπονται οι καινοτόμες λύσεις. Δεύτερον, θα πρέπει να είναι δυνατή η χρήση των όρων για γενική χρήση UWB και για εφαρμογές ανίχνευσης υλικών. Τρίτον, θα πρέπει να υπάρχει όριο -65 dBm/MHz για όλες τις συσκευές ανίχνευσης υλικών, συμπεριλαμβανομένων των συσκευών ανάλυσης δομικών υλικών (BMA) στη ζώνη των 8,5-10,6 GHz. Τέταρτον, για τα συστήματα ελέγχου πρόσβασης οχημάτων που βασίζονται στην τεχνολογία UWB θα πρέπει να εισαχθεί η δυνατότητα μετριασμού με σκανδαλισμό προ της εκπομπής (trigger-before-transmit) στις ζώνες συχνοτήτων 3,8-4,2 GHz και 6-8,5 GHz.\n(5)\nΗ παρούσα απόφαση θα πρέπει να στηρίξει τη συνολική εναρμόνιση του κανονιστικού πλαισίου της υπερευρείας ζώνης, προκειμένου να βελτιωθεί η συνοχή των ορίων και των τεχνικών μετριασμού μεταξύ των διαφόρων κανονισμών της υπερευρείας ζώνης και να μην αποκλείονται οι καινοτόμες λύσεις στον τομέα της τεχνολογίας υπερευρείας ζώνης.\n(6)\nΗ παρούσα απόφαση προβλέπει κανονιστικά όρια και προσδιορίζει τεχνικές μετριασμού για να εξασφαλιστεί η αποτελεσματική χρήση του φάσματος, με διασφάλιση της συνύπαρξης με άλλους χρήστες του φάσματος.
