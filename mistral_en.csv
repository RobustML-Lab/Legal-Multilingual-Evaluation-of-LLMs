Given that the text directly addresses issues related to education (enrolment and school completion), my initial thought is category 4 - Quality Education. However, if we consider that climate change can affect access to education (for instance, natural disasters disrupting schools or causing families to move), it could also somewhat fit in category 13 - Climate Action. It would be best to analyze the specific context and solutions suggested in the text to make a definitive choice."

The text discusses issues related to inmates' basic needs, particularly nutrition (which is part of Clean Water and Sanitation SDG 6), but it also highlights inequality in accessing adequate food due to the practice of selling food meant for prisoners (which could align with Reduced Inequalities SDG 10). Both categories are relevant here, but since the primary focus seems to be on nutritional requirements and inadequate food supply, SDG 6 - CLEAN WATER AND SANITATION might be more appropriate.
